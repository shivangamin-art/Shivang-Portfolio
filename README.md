## Overview

This project is my personal portfolio website created for the course INFR3120 – Web and Scripting Programming.
The website is built using HTML5 and CSS3, and it is hosted live using GitHub Pages.

It contains 4 different pages:

- Home Page: Includes navigation to all sections.
- About Me Page: Contains a photo, a short introduction, and an embedded video (45–60 seconds).
- Projects Page: Lists and explains 4–5 projects I worked on.
- Contact Page: Features a contact form with validation (Name, Email, Phone, Comments).

## Viewport Sizes (Responsiveness)

I used a fluid design with media queries and created separate CSS files for each viewport:

- Mobile: `max-width: 600px` → Optimized for small screens.
- Tablet: `min-width: 601px and max-width: 900px` → Adjusts layout for tablets.
- Laptop/Desktop: `min-width: 901px` → Full layout for larger displays.

These breakpoints were chosen because they are common device widths and ensure a smooth responsive experience.

## Gradients

I applied linear and angle linear gradients on the site:

- Home Page background: uses a vertical linear gradient for a modern look.
- Contact form section: uses an angled linear gradient to highlight the form area.

## Color Scheme

I used a custom color palette generated with [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create):

- Primary: `#7c5cff` (brand purple)
- Accent: `#ff6aa9` (brand pink)
- Background: `#0b1020` (dark)
- Text (ink): `#e7e9ee` (light gray)
- Muted text: `#b7bfd6`

This scheme provides strong contrast, modern aesthetics, and good readability.
