## Site Structure  
The website contains 4 pages:  
1. Home Page – Introduction with navigation links.  
2. About Me Page – My photo, short bio, and a 45–60s embedded video with controls and poster image.  
3. Projects Page – Showcases 4–5 projects with titles and short descriptions.  
4. Contact Me Page – Includes a form with input validation (Name, Email, Cell No., Comments).  

A footer is present on all pages containing my email and copyright.  
Semantic HTML tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, and `<article>` are used appropriately.  

## GUI & Interface  

- Responsiveness:  
  The site uses fluid design with media queries. Separate CSS files are included for each viewport:  
  - `mobile.css` → up to 600px (phones)  
  - `tablet.css` → 601px – 900px (tablets)  
  - `laptop.css` → 901px and above (laptops/desktops)  
  These breakpoints were chosen based on standard device screen widths.  

- Gradients:  
  A linear gradient and angled gradient are applied in the Projects page background to create visual depth.  

- Color Scheme:  
  The color palette was generated using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create).  
  - Background: `#0b1020`  
  - Text: `#e7e9ee`  
  - Muted text: `#b7bfd6`  
  - Accent colors: `#7c5cff` (brand1), `#ff6aa9` (brand2)  
  I chose this scheme for a modern, professional look with strong contrast and readability.
